  - Cotton **fibers** are single cells that have been differentiated from the **ovule epidermis** and serve as a model system for research on single-cell differentiation, growth, and fiber production.
  - We discuss the mechanisms by which phytohormones regulate **the initiation and elongation of fiber cells** in cotton, as well as the identification of genes involved in hormone biosynthetic and signaling pathways that regulate the initiation, elongation, and development of cotton fibers.
  - Fiber developmental stages include initiation, elongation, secondary wall biosynthesis, and maturation
